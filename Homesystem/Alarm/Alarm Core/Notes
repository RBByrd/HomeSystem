The Alarm core will be an arduino based model that will used as an IO board

There are 4 Alarm Zones and the Horn While the alarm zones have closed switches the area is secure.

Zone 1
	Front Door 
	Dining Room Window
Zone 2
	Living Room Window
Zone 3
	Bathroom Window
	4 Kitchen Windows
	Back Door
Zone 4
	Side Door
Horn
	Note: The horn will need to be driven by another power source. The IO port should control a relay to sound the Horn.

Functions

While all areas are secure and alarm system is disabled the alarm system can be actived and the horn is silent

	If zone becomes unsecure the horn chimes

		The alarm system cannot be activated

	If the alarm system is set to home

		While the alarm is set to home
			The alarm can de deactived

			if a zone 

The alarm will utilize the EEPROM of the arduino so save information.
	-Passcode
	-settings
	-Whether the system has been initailized or not
	-which zones the user would like to monitor
	-if the system has been armed.
		-this will be the most common change of the system
		-estimating 2 changes a day (alarm active, deactivate)
		-Note: An EEPROM write takes 3.3 ms to complete. The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles, so you may need to be careful about how often you write to it.
		-this would give the alarm about a ~137 year lifespan.
		-Looking into the arduino forums this seems to be a per memory bit bases.
		- if that is the case then the alarm state can be moved every 99,000 changes. 
		-This would give the eeprom arduino a lifespan greater then the arduino as a whole
		-The lifespan of the arduino board is estimated to be 20-30 years. (dependent on the running conditions)
	-the alarm state address
		-this may not be needed as stated above the EEPROM should probably outlast the arduino. even at an alarm state change of 8 times a day (estimated 34 years.)
