This project will look to automate my home with the use of a central computer system

Computer system
	Raspberry Pi
	Arduino

Electronics
	//installed

	//wired ready to be installed
		Magnetic switches
			There are many installed in the home that are currently attached to the unused alarm system.
			Doors
			Windows
		Motion Sensor
			A single motion sensor was insalled in the living room that was used by the alarm system
			The motion system has not been tested, and is currently uninstalled, but the wiring is still intact.

	//needs to be wired
		Ethernet cabling
			To best suit the home there are number of different ways that the ethernet can be run through the home. This is a suggestion
				Utility closet
					The most central location of the home
					The alarm system is there
					Will require 4 wires to be run to the top floor
						1 (3 total) for each non bathroom room
							will there be a reason to run ethernet to the bathroom?
						1 for future camera system
							This last one could be run to a switch for PoE devices including, but not limited to the cameras,
								The location of this switch should be in an air conditioned location, as it will probably use a battery backup
					Will require 3 cables to be run for the downstairs rooms.
						1 for living room
							could be run through the crawspace
						1 for the game//dining room
							could be run through the crawl space
						1 for the kitchen
							probably won't be done until the kitchen is remodeled
		RGB Lights
			locations
				Outside Under West overhang
				Outside Under backyard patio
				Living room center beam
		Alarm Display
			Touch screen display to replace the old alarm keypad
		Doorbell//camera
